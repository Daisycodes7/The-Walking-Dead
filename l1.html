    <h1 id="title1a">ABOUT TWD</h1>
<p>The Walking Dead is a post-apocalyptic horror franchise centred around a world overrun by zombies.
It started as a comic book series by Robert Kirkman, then expanded into a hugely popular TV show, spin-offs, video games, 
    and more.
 The main TV series (2010–2022) follows Rick Grimes, a former sheriff who wakes from a coma to find the world in chaos.
    He leads a group of survivors through dangers not just from the undead but also from other humans, who often turn out
    to be even more dangerous.
    
    It’s known for its intense storytelling, brutal deaths, and themes of survival, morality, and human nature.</p>
